# Notes

 - Mostly a vanilla C project
 - Building does not require any special dependencies (other than standard X libs)
 - Some files are automatically generated (see below)

## Autogenerated files (do not edit by hand)

 - `README.md` is generated from `README.md.t`
 - `man.md` is generated from `man.md.t`
 - `src/cfg.h`
 - `src/cfg.c`

Updating the above files should be done by editing `cfg.opts` and running `make assets` (requires pandoc and python3)
